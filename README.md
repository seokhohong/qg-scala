Q-Gomoku

Q-Gomoku is an AlphaGo/AlphaZero inspired program trained to play the game of Gomoku at a super-human level. Deep Q Learning is a reinforcement learning technique augmented by deep learning so that just by simply playing the game over and over again, it can improve upon its mistakes and perfect its gameplay.

Gomoku is a simple game, an extension of Tic-Tac-Toe if you will. In this variation, the goal is to get five of your stones in a row before your opponent on a 9x9 board.
